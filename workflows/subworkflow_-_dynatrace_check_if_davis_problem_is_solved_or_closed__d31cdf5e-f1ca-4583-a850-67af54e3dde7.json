If the problem is still open, the subworkflow will fail.\n\nYou can configure the \"retry on error\" setting in the parent workflow to retry this subworkflow for a specific durationfor example,\nrun for 10 minutes and check periodically if the problem has been resolved.\n\nIf the problem is not resolved within the defined time window, you can:\n\n* Add another remediation step.\n* Escalate the issue to a human operator.\n\nThis approach enables automated, iterative problem resolution while maintaining control over escalation and fallback strategies.\n\nParameters:\n\ndynatrace_problem_display_id: (Reguired) Davis Problem id (for example P-25051158)","actor":"bc935a57-c7d3-440e-922c-79a22bf7afd6","owner":"bc935a57-c7d3-440e-922c-79a22bf7afd6","ownerType":"USER","isPrivate":false,"triggerType":"Manual","schemaVersion":3,"trigger":{},"modificationInfo":{"createdBy":"bc935a57-c7d3-440e-922c-79a22bf7afd6","createdTime":"2026-01-15T04:09:54.385Z","lastModifiedBy":"bc935a57-c7d3-440e-922c-79a22bf7afd6","lastModifiedTime":"2026-01-15T04:09:54.385Z"},"result":"{{ result(\"check-if-problem-solved\") }}","type":"STANDARD","input":{"dynatrace_problem_display_id":"P-25051158"},"hourlyExecutionLimit":1000,"throttle":{"isLimitHit":false,"limitEvents":[]},"workflowLimit":{"isActive":false},"version":1,"unacknowledgedSkippedScheduleAt":null,"tasks":{"check-if-problem-solved":{"name":"check-if-problem-solved","input":{"query":"fetch events, from: now()-7d\n| filter matchesPhrase(display_id,\"{{input()[\"dynatrace_problem_display_id\"] }}\" ) and matchesValue(event.status_transition, \"RESOLVED\" ) or matchesPhrase(display_id,\"{{input()[\"dynatrace_problem_display_id\"] }}\" ) and matchesValue(event.status_transition, \"CLOSED\" )","failOnEmptyResult":true},"action":"dynatrace.automations:execute-dql-query","position":{"x":0,"y":1},"conditions":{"custom":"","states":{}},"description":"Make use of Dynatrace Grail data in your workflow.","predecessors":[]}}}
