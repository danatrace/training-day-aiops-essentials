If not, it will fail the subworkflow to provide a restart on error\nfunctionality to the Parent workflow\n\nThis subworkflow Needs subworkflow \"subworkflow - aws wait for systems manager document execution\"\n\nSteps to Import AWS SSM Document/Runbook Yaml:\n***********************************************\n1.) Open the Following link https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/documents/create-document?region=us-east-1#documentType=Automation\n    That will take you to the AWS Management Console (you need to be logged in) and open the Runbook builder to create a new Runbook.\n\n2.) If needed change the aws region of the Runbook in the console\n3.) In the upper left corner Change the Runbook name into \"Dynwf-CreateCloudFormationStack\"\n4.) Click on the {} Code button next to the runbook name this will take you to the yaml def. of the runbook\n5.) Paste the Yaml content below into the code field\n\n# yaml file start\nschemaVersion: '0.3'\ndescription: |-\n  *Replace this default text with instructions or other information about your runbook.*\n\n  ---\n  # What is Markdown?\n  Markdown is a lightweight markup language that converts your content with plain text formatting to structurally valid rich text.\n  ## You can add headings\n  You can add *italics* or make the font **bold**.\n  1.
